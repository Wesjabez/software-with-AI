# SOFTWARE LEARNING WITH AI
     
     GETTING STARTED WITH NODE JS

-Node js is an open source cross platform run time environment that allows users to run javascript code outside the browser,typically on the server side.

      REASON
-Node js brought javascript to the backend enabling for fullstack web development.

      OBJECTIVE
- To build a simple server side data base with node js


      BACKGROUND
      
-Before, javascript was almost used entirely for front end development until developers brought javascript to backend developmet allowing for fullstack development using a single unified language. 
-it is built on Google's V8 javascript engine which compiles javascript into fast native machine code.
-it's vast npm registry also provides a lot of packages offering ready made solutions  for common problems and accelerating development.

      SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- A working operating system i.e windows OS, mac OS, Linux
- A code editor
- Node installed

      INSTALLATION GUIDE
- Download node from the official node js website with regards to the operating system , https://nodejs.org/en
- run the installer application.
- verify the installation, node -v
- install sqlite3 library, npm install better-sqlite3


     WORKING EXAMPLE
- Refer to the [database.js](./database.js) file

     AI PROMPT JOURNAL
 
               getting started with node
prompt used: I want to learn node js and i would like you to explain to me in detail as a software engineer what it is and also give  me a brief overview of the recommended sequence for learning the concepts used in node.


              project initialisation
prompt used: lets start with the project initialisation and folder creation, take me through ensuring that all the system requirements have been installed together with the dependencies required for node js setup for creating a backend database using nodejs.


              code development
prompt used: Take me through the process of creating a simple user model that contains the user's name and email as the entries for the database. while creating the model explain to me the key concepts that I should take keen interest in while developing database models using node js and the respective dependencies needed. Explain these concepts in a short but concise way ensuring that the idea comes across clearly without having to use a cluster of words.

 -lets now handle CRUD operations, I need to be able to create a new user, read all the users available in the database, update users in the database and delete users in the database.Explain the key concepts in a clear way 

      COMMON ISSUES AND FIXES
- one of the issue that I came across was during the initialisation process,running the command node -v to show the node version and hence validate node installation returned uknown error even after I double checked that I had installed node correctly and that the path variables had been updated successfully.

fix: I figured out that doing a restart of the system solved that issue.
